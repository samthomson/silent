- don't add mindless commentary, comment when you've done something complicated. good code should be readable itself.
- no need to run tests after every change, unless you have good reason to
- less code is always better. aim to write as concise readable code as possible. do not repeat yourself, avoid bloat. your overarching goal is to produce as small a diff as possible while completing any task
